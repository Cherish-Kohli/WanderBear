# WanderBear
Event Planning Platform: Developed a stateless web application using Node.js, Docker, and AWS.
Implemented a mashup of Ticketmaster API, YouTube Data API, TripAdvisor API, and
Wikimedia API. Leveraged AWS S3 as the cloud persistence service for page views and user
interactions. Deployed my app on EC2 instance using DockerHub.
